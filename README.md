# Landing Page

Browser application called "landing-page" is a landing website for an unknown company. The website was built by following the provided designs and implementing of pixel perfect styling. The project was done in three parts. This is the second part which doesn't have any js. Has features such as: 

+ Responsive design for desktops, tablets and smartphones,
+ Dark and Light theme modes. Consistent during reloads.

## Installation

Open up your terminal and run this command 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanbolsyn/landing-page.git 
```

After cloning is finished run this command
```bash
cd landing-page/
```

Switch to "landing-m2" branch 
```bash
git switch landing-m2
```

There to ways of running task-planner locally
1. Running it using Live Server(VS code extension)
2. Or run this command on your terminal instead

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Live server will open up the browser window automatically. The second way will provide you the link on your terminal that you have to follow. Unfortunately, the application doesn't work on Safari(working on it). 

Congratulations you installed my application. Hopefully you will be able to enjoy it.
